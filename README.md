# Replay Manager for Slippi
Replay Manager for Slippi helps users integrate [Slippi replays](https://github.com/project-slippi/slippi-wiki/blob/master/SPEC.md) with [start.gg](https://www.start.gg/) brackets.
It enables a workflow where Slippi replays are collected set-by-set, used to report set results (including character and stage data), and grouped/labelled for easier organization.
