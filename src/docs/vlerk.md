# Vlerk Mode
### aka Post-tournament supplemental reporting
Replay Manager for Slippi is meant to support a real-time set reporting flow.
However for those that want to use Slippi replays to supplement already reported sets on start.gg with game, character, and stage data, 'Vlerk Mode' adds the following features when using start.gg:
* Search box for player names
* Completed sets are expanded by default in phaseGroups
* A checkbox graphic indicates if a set has been reported through this app since it was last opened (does not persist if you close the app)
* All events/phases/phaseGroups/sets are initially fetched for a tournament
